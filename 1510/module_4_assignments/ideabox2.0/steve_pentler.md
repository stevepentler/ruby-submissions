# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
- [qualityIdea](https://github.com/stevepentler/IdeaBox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/quality_idea.js#L30)
DRY after refactoring from seperate promote and demote methods.
- [searchIdea](https://github.com/stevepentler/IdeaBox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search_idea.js#L1) : Well named, human-readable, abstracted code.
- [Controller Testing](https://github.com/stevepentler/IdeaBox/blob/master/test/controllers/ideas_controller_test.rb#L25)
Specific, realiable controller testing for create, update, and delete. Decent testing for idea promotion/demotion.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
- [editIdea](https://github.com/stevepentler/IdeaBox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit_idea.js#L7): I tried to refactor this code on 5 seperate occassions, but kept running into a problem with the contentEditable function. Whenever I moved the contentEditable, I ran into scoping issues that prevented inline editing. 
- [Selenium Integration Test](https://github.com/stevepentler/IdeaBox/blob/master/test/integration/create_idea_test.rb): This isn't pretty, but I was excited to get Selenium working. I had trouble selecting specific elements.
